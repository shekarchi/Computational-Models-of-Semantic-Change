In this lab, it is asked to collect n-gram data from a corpora (n = 1, 2, 3), 
tabulate them in .csv files, 
and generate 5 English sentences of length = 6 to 10 (in n-gram orders) by sampling from the data collected.

For running the code, a text file should be provided.
Then, filenames for saving 1-3-grams data should be provided in order.

The following lines are the output of lab0.py:
