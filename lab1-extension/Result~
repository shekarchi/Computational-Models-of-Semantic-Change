This is the result after some smoothing modifications:

pearson-correlation coefficient for M1:  (0.14186678886345638, 0.25962130953623669)
pearson-correlation coefficient for M1_plus:  (0.29579175729513912, 0.016744228414444336)
pearson-correlation coefficient for M2_10:  (0.077734295196607309, 0.53823376816404234)
pearson-correlation coefficient for M2_50:  (0.2565337907475061, 0.039134575373536568)
pearson-correlation coefficient for M2_100:  (0.32691927823775319,0.0081604375478647771)

This is the result for pre-trained word2vec model:

pearson-correlation coefficient for word2vec: 0.76

For step 4:
accuracy for LSA_100 - over semantic data = 0.008 
                      (The vectors are zero, as the model is not trained on big data)
                     - over syntactic data = 0.017 
                      (There are a lot of zero vectors)
accuracy for word2vec - over semantic data = 0.87
                      - over syntactic data = 0.71 
                       (we see the accuracy for semantic data is better!)
